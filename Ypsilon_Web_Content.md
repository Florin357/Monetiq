## 1. App Description (Website Content)

### Overview

Ypsilon is a personal finance app designed to help you track loans, manage income, and stay on top of your payment schedule. Whether you're lending money to a friend, managing a personal loan, or tracking a bank credit, Ypsilon provides a clear overview of your financial commitments without complexity or privacy concerns.

All your data stays securely on your device. No account required, no cloud sync, no tracking.

### Who It's For

Ypsilon is for anyone who wants to:

- Keep track of money they've lent or borrowed
- Monitor bank loans and credit obligations
- Manage income sources and upcoming paydays
- See a clear overview of upcoming payments and cash flow
- Maintain full control over their financial data
- Track recurring subscriptions and one-time expenses

### What Problems It Solves

Managing personal loans and income can be challenging without the right tools. Ypsilon solves these common problems:

- **Scattered Information:** All your loans, income, and payment schedules in one place
- **Missed Payments:** Clear visibility of upcoming and overdue payments
- **Cash Flow Uncertainty:** A 30-day projection of your financial flow
- **Privacy Concerns:** Your data never leaves your device
- **Complexity:** Simple, straightforward interface focused on what matters
- **Recurring Subscriptions:** Track monthly, yearly, and one-time expenses without spreadsheets
- **Past Clutter:** Automatic monthly archiving keeps your view focused on what's next

### Core Features

#### Loan Tracking

Track money you've lent to others, borrowed from friends, or owe to banks. Add loan details including principal amount, interest rate, payment frequency, and repayment schedule. Mark payments as paid and see your progress at a glance. Overdue payments are clearly highlighted based on calendar days.

#### Income Management

Add income sources with recurring paydays—weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or one-time. Track salary, freelance income, or any other revenue stream. See upcoming income alongside loan payments for a complete financial picture.

#### Expenses & Subscriptions

Track recurring subscriptions (monthly, quarterly, yearly, weekly) and one-time expenses. Set your payment day once, and Ypsilon preserves it across months (e.g., the 14th stays the 14th). See "subscription age" labels showing how long you've been subscribed (months, quarters, or years). Past expenses are automatically organized into a monthly archive (grouped by month and year), so your active view stays focused on what's coming next.

#### Dashboard Overview

View totals for money to receive and money to pay. See all upcoming payments in one unified list, sorted by due date. Quickly identify overdue items and take action. Dashboard totals and the upcoming list reflect what's coming next from Loans, Income, and Expenses. Past items are automatically archived, keeping the dashboard focused and clutter-free.

#### Cashflow Projection

A 30-day chart shows your expected cash flow based on scheduled payments and income. The projection includes scheduled payments and income from Loans, Income sources, and Expenses based on what you've entered. Track net flow over time and plan ahead with confidence.

#### Loan Calculator

Calculate loan payments with adjustable interest rates, payment frequency, and loan terms. Experiment with different scenarios before committing to a loan.

#### Multi-Currency Support

Add loans and income in different currencies. Each entry displays in its original currency, making it easy to manage international finances.

#### Payment Actions

Mark payments as paid or postpone reminders with a single tap. Stay in control of your payment schedule.

### How Ypsilon Works

1. **Add Your Loans:** Enter details about money you've lent, borrowed, or owe to banks
2. **Track Your Income:** Add income sources with recurring paydays
3. **View Upcoming Payments:** See all scheduled payments and income in one clear list
4. **Monitor Cash Flow:** Check your 30-day financial projection
5. **Take Action:** Mark payments as paid or postpone reminders as needed

### Designed for Simplicity & Control

Ypsilon is built with a focus on clarity and ease of use. No complicated features, no overwhelming dashboards—just the information you need, when you need it. The app respects your time and your intelligence by presenting financial data in a straightforward, actionable format. Ypsilon does not tell you what to do with your money. It helps you see it clearly.

### Privacy & Data Ownership

Your financial information is sensitive, and Ypsilon treats it that way. All data is stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage. There are no accounts to create, no servers to sync with, and no third parties with access to your information. Your data is yours, and it stays with you.

Ypsilon uses notifications only to remind you of upcoming payments—and only if you enable them. You have complete control over when and how you're notified.

### Why Choose Ypsilon

- **Privacy-First:** Your data never leaves your device
- **No Account Required:** Start tracking immediately
- **Multi-Currency:** Manage finances in any currency
- **Clear Overdue Detection:** Know exactly what's overdue
- **Simple Interface:** Focus on what matters
- **Complete Control:** Mark paid, postpone, or adjust as needed

Ypsilon is for people who value clarity, control, and privacy in their personal finance management.

## 2. Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026

### Introduction

Ypsilon is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your financial data is personal and sensitive, and we believe it should remain under your control at all times.

### Data Collection

Ypsilon collects and stores the following information locally on your device:

- Loan information (principal amount, interest rate, counterparty details, payment schedules)
- Income sources and payment schedules
- Payment history (marked as paid or postponed)
- Expense and subscription entries (including recurring schedules)
- App preferences and settings (currency, language, notification preferences, appearance mode)

**Important:** All data is stored exclusively on your device. Ypsilon does not transmit, upload, or sync any of your financial information to external servers or third-party services.

### How We Use Your Information

The data you enter into Ypsilon is used solely to provide the app's functionality:

- Display loan and income information
- Calculate payment schedules and cash flow projections
- Send local notifications for upcoming payments (if you enable notifications)
- Maintain your app preferences

Your data is never used for analytics, advertising, profiling, or any purpose beyond the core functionality of the app.

### Data Storage and Security

All data is stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage mechanisms provided by Apple. The security of your data depends on:

- Your device's passcode or biometric authentication
- iOS system-level security features
- Optional Face ID/Touch ID app lock (if you enable it in settings)

Ypsilon does not implement additional encryption beyond what iOS provides by default, as all data remains on-device and is protected by iOS security features.

### Data Sharing

Ypsilon does not share, sell, transmit, or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third parties. There are no analytics services, advertising networks, or data brokers involved.

The only exception is if you explicitly choose to export or share data using iOS system features (such as sharing a screenshot or using system backup features). These actions are entirely under your control.

### Notifications

If you enable notifications in the app settings, Ypsilon will schedule local notifications on your device to remind you of upcoming payments. These notifications are generated and delivered entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to external servers.

You can disable notifications at any time in the app settings or in iOS system settings.

### User Control and Data Deletion

You have complete control over your data:

- **Edit or Delete Entries:** You can modify or delete any loan, income source, or payment at any time
- **Reset App:** You can delete all data by using the "Reset App" option in settings
- **Uninstall:** Deleting the app from your device permanently removes all data

There is no account to close or server-side data to request deletion of, as no data ever leaves your device.

### Children's Privacy

Ypsilon is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app, you can simply delete the app from their device to remove all data.
